I'd like to acknowledge the use of tutorial and lab material for this assignment, specifically for the e-mail validation code, age validation code and phone number validation code from week 3 and week 4 tutorials.

I used the checkForm() code as a reference and guide also.

I'd also like to acknowledge the use of lecture material and online resources such as www.w3schools.com.

I'd like to acknowledge having used sample code from tutorials, in particular, utils.php and others from week 8.
